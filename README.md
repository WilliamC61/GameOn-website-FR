## Purpose

This project implements  the mock-up of an information and subscription  web site for video games competitions.

The mock-up implements mainly the subscription form and give an idea of the site look and feel.

## Structure

The site graphical model is given in the on-line UI design tool Figma : [GameOn UI-design](https://www.figma.com/file/B7NKBDvSI18uoMLJgpnh48/UI-Design-GameOn-FR?node-id=106%3A630)

The site includes mainly 3 parts:

- A welcome page which includes:
  -  The header with the GameOn company logo and a navigation menu to display different informations. The menu options are not implemented only the menu display is. The menu is displayed on one line for wide screens (>=1200px) and as a burger menu for smaller screen
  - a main part indicating the site purpose and a button to launch the subscription.
  - a footer with a copyright message
- a first modal window containing the subscription form with all the input fields to enter the subscription data 
- a second modal window to confirm the subscription if all the necessary data have been correctly input at the form submit.

## Implementation

The ğŸ“‚starterOnly directory contains all the files of the project itself:

- ğŸ“œindex.html: HTML code of the page
- ğŸ“œmenu.js: JavaScript code for managing the burger menu
- ğŸ“œmodal.js: JavaScript code for managing modals

The ğŸ“‚public subdirectory includes the image resources, and the CSS generated by  SASS compilation with the associated map used for debugging.

The ğŸ“‚sass subdirectory contains a classic sass tree structure:

- ğŸ“‚layout: includes the 2 elements that could be common to other pages (even if here we only have one page for this mock-up) : ğŸ“œ_header.scss and ğŸ“œ_ footer.scss.
- ğŸ“‚pages: includes the ğŸ“œ_index.scss file specific to the home page._
- ğŸ“‚utils: only ğŸ“œ_mixins.scss and ğŸ“œ_variables.scss are used.

At the root ğŸ“¦GameOn-website-FR, there is the present ğŸ“œREADME.md file, and configurations files:

- ğŸ“œeslintrc.js : eslint configuration.
-  ğŸ“œ.gitignore : files to be ignored by git .
-  ğŸ“œpackage-lock.json, ğŸ“œpackage.json : list of packages used.
- ğŸ“œwokspace.code-workspace : configuration for VScode.

All the files are extensively commented.
